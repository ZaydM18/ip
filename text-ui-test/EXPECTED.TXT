 Huh? You just left that description blank, friend. How can one make a list with this?
____________________________________________________________
 Deadlines must include a '/by' followed by a due date. Hopefully there's no deadline on how long I can keep making lists...
____________________________________________________________
 Ah! Another error! MUST MAKE LIST! An event must include '/from' and '/to'
____________________________________________________________
 What are you saying? Please tell me again. I must add it to the list!

 Bye. Hope to see you again soon!
